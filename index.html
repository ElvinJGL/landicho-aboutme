            <p class="text">I'm an ambivert type of person when it
                 comes to communicating with others. I easily get curious about things that
                  interest me. I'm neither good nor bad when it comes to academics. My only 
                  favorite subjects in school are mathematics and TLE, or ICT. Honestly, I get
                   very tired easily from anything I do, whether it is playing games, doing
                   homework, or just killing time. I don't want you to have high expectations 
                   from me, as I'm not sure what my strengths are yet.

            <h1 class="h1">Hobbies</h1>
            <p class="text">For now, my only hobbies are playing games and sleeping.
                My go-to games are gacha games, rhythm games, MOBA, RTS, soul games,
                shooting games, or any games that I find interesting and fun. Im trying to
                find a hobby that really interests me so that I don't get tired of it.
                One of them is programming, and the others can be drawing, playing an
                instrument, or physical fitness.</p>

            <h1 class="h1">Achivements</h1>
            <p class="text">I graduated pre-school in Mandaluyong Elementary School with a
                 certificate of "With Honors." I started taking school seriously when I
                  entered junior high at Mandaluyong High School. In grade 10, I joined the
                   math club and was rewarded with a gold medal and certificate in sudoku.
                    I have good grades in my math class; that helps to have a certificate of
                     "With Honors" again before I graduated from junior high school.
                      Now I'm a senior high school student, studying for TVL track and 
                      hoping to expand my knowledge about programming. </p>

            <h1 class="h1">Goal</h1>
            <p class="text">As for my goal in life, I want to pursue an information technology
                 course and become a developer someday; it can be a web developer or game
                  developer. The reason for this is because of my siblings, whose careers are
                   more focused on developing technologies. I also want to be like them, so I
                    can ask questions about this course easily since they are more experienced.
